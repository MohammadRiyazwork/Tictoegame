Overview:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game that is played on a 3×3 grid. The players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbol — either X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a draw.
